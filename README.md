## Features

- ðŸ“· **Simple Image Upload:** Drag and drop or click to upload parking lot images
- ðŸ”¢ **Automatic Analysis:** Provides counts of total, occupied, and available parking spaces
- ðŸ“Š **CSV Export:** Download results as CSV files for further analysis
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices
- ðŸš— **Quick Results:** Process images and receive results within seconds

## How It Works

The Parking Lot Analyzer uses a combination of computer vision techniques and predefined parameters to:

1. Accept an uploaded parking lot image
2. Process the image to determine the total number of parking spaces
3. Estimate which spaces are occupied vs. available
4. Generate a CSV file with the analysis results
5. Display statistics to the user

   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p uploads results
   ```

5. Run the application:

   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:**
   - Click on the drop zone or drag and drop a parking lot image
   - The image will appear in the preview area

2. **Analyze:**
   - Click the "Analyze Parking Lot" button
   - The application will process the image

3. **View Results:**
   - See total, occupied, and available parking space counts
   - Results are displayed in color-coded cards

4. **Export Data:**
   - Click the "Download CSV Results" button to save the data
   - The CSV file contains total, occupied, and available counts

5. **Analyze Another Image:**
   - Click "Analyze Another Image" to start over

## Code Explanation

### app.py

The main Flask application that:
- Handles HTTP routes and requests
- Processes uploaded images
- Calls the parking detection algorithms
- Generates and serves CSV files

Key functions:
- `index()`: Renders the main page
- `analyze()`: Processes uploaded images and returns results
- `uploaded_file()` and `result_file()`: Serve static files

### parking_detection.py

Contains the core logic for parking space detection:
- `manual_count_based_on_image()`: Analyzes the image to count spaces
- `export_results_to_csv()`: Creates CSV files with parking data

### index.html

The frontend interface featuring:
- Responsive Bootstrap layout
- Drag and drop file upload
- Interactive results display
- Dynamic statistics cards

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Render. You can access it here:

**Live Demo:** https://parking-lot-analyzer.onrender.com

### Deployment Environment

- **Platform:** Render Web Service
- **Runtime:** Python 3.10
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Web Server:** Gunicorn

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time camera feed analysis
- Add historical data tracking and trending
- Integrate mapping services to locate available parking
- Implement user authentication for private lots
- Add multi-lot management capabilities
